# Variables, If-Else Statements and While Loops

This tutorial covers the basics of variables, if-else statements, and while loops in C programming language. 

## Variables

In C programming, a variable is a piece of memory that can store a value of a specific data type. C supports the following data types:

* char
* int
* float
* double

Example:

```c
int age = 10;
float height = 5.2;
```

## If-Else Statements

If-else statements are used to control the flow of a program. The syntax of an if-else statement looks like this:

```c
if (condition)
{
    // code to execute if condition is true
}
else
{

}
else
{
